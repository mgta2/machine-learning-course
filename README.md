# Data Science and Machine Learning Course

Completed notebooks for the DS and ML course from Coding Nomads: https://codingnomads.co/courses/data-science-machine-learning-course.

## Content

The course uses Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sklearn packages. The notebooks cover:

1. Linear & Polynomial Regression: MSE & Loss Functions
2. Gradient Descent: Regularization
3. Dataset Scaling: Predicting House Prices
4. Model Evaluation: Train and Test Data
5. Metrics (F1-Score etc.): Cancer Detection
6. Decision Trees: Spam detection & Validation Curves
7. Cross Validation, Hyper-Parameter Tuning (GridSearch & RandomSearch)
8. Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost & RandomForest): Digit Classification
9. (a) Data Processing/Cleaning: Website Business Customers (b) Pipelines & NLP: Classifying News
10. Clustering (KMeans & DBSCAN, Silhouette Score): Customer Data
11. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA): Customer Data

## Capstone Project

The course ends with a final project: to build a machine learning model from start to finish. My Capstone Project is in the machine-learning-capstone-project repository.
