In this investigation we want to find if there are any natural groups of customers in my dataset.  The first step is to just get the data in a format we can feed to our machine learning models. Once we do that, then our boss (some dude named Gilad), said he will teach us how to cluster the customers! But it turns out you need to have the _data_ formatted in some special way...? Maybe you can tell me about that!"

The first column is titled \"first_name\" and it seems to be the first name of each customer. Is this a usable feature? Well... not exactly in string format. So I guess I could one hot encode them into binary vectors, but even then... do I want to cluster the customers based on their first name? You can imagine some situation where clustering by name might be relevant (for example trying to guess what generation someone belonged to?) but in this case it seems like it's more of a unique identifier so it may be best to simply remove it. If every value in a column is unique (there are no duplications of the value) then we shouldn't use it as a feature because it will have a 1-1 mapping with the target variable which is not something we ever want. We want our model to learn and generalize from the features, not memorize that the name \"jane\" bought 5 cans of soda.\n",

    "Above fills in the missing data for 'money_spent' and 'prob_of_rebuy' using the mean average. One might expect 'total_num_of_transactions' to have an effect on these variables (e.g. if a customer has bought more stuff, it's more likely that they've spent more). So it might be better to fill in the missing values using a model trained from that data, instead of always putting in the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean might also be a poor indicator if our data is very spread out. For example, it might be the case that we have a few customers who spent loads, while the rest spend little with few users in between. In this scenario, just using the mean won't help us decide which category that customer belongs to. As always, it would be important to look at the data and see if this is the case (before deciding what strategy to employ for filling in the missing values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thought: when we fill in missing values, our new data doesn't 'remember' which data is real and which data is guessed. It might be a good idea to look into the possibility of weighting our data's reliability and somehow getting this into the model. In this way, the model would make decisions/structure itself in a way which is biased towards our 'real' data (instead of putting too much focus on the guessed data). For example, in a decision tree classifier with the gini coefficient, we could categorise the data as 'real'/'guessed' and incorporate this into the gini formula to prioritize splitting the real data over the guessed data."
